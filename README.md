## pickmypc
Computer selector website

Pick My PC will be a website built on Flask through Python. The goal of the website is to help people decide what computer they should buy to most accurately fit their needs. 

The website will ask the user a series of questions, in a similar fashion to the game “20 questions”, and eventually the user will reach an ending where an optimally configured system will be presented to them. 

It would work well in an algorithm format, with predetermined end results set for each category of computer system for each budget chunk.

## changes
- After extensive attempts at running a python script that takes user input from a PHP website running on an apache server on Windows, it's too difficult.
- I managed to get to the point where it was possible to go to localhost/test.py, but could not insert that same test.py into a <div> within my website where I wanted it to run.
- I am reverting to a standalone Python program that will serve the same purpose.
