# pickmypc
Computer selector website

Pick My PC will be a website built on Flask through Python. The goal of the website is to help people decide what computer they should buy to most accurately fit their needs. 

The website will ask the user a series of questions, in a similar fashion to the game “20 questions”, and eventually the user will reach an ending where an optimally configured system will be presented to them. 

It would work well in an algorithm format, with predetermined end results set for each category of computer system for each budget chunk.
